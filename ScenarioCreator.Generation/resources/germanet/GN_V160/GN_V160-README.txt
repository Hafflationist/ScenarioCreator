External Data Mappings
======================

* Mappings between Wiktionary sense descriptions and GermaNet’s lexical units are available for download on the GermaNet homepage.

The Wiktionary sense descriptions are subject to the Creative Commons Attribution/Share-Alike License (CC BY-SA 3.0) (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/).

* The Interlingual Index (ILI) maps GermaNet senses to their corresponding entries in Princeton WordNet®. These mappings are also available for download on the GermaNet homepage.

Please note that license conditions for Princeton WordNet(R) differ from license conditions for GermaNet.

Associated Applications and Tools
=================================

* Java and Python APIs:
	provide easy access to all information in GermaNet, with search filtering, and methods for calculating the semantic relatedness of two synsets.

*  GermaNet Rover (https://weblicht.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/rover/):
	A web application for exploring GermaNet, including search, semantic relatedness, and visualization. Single sign-on is used, which means that you can log in through your academic institution.

See the "Applications and Tools" section of the homepage for more information.

Some of the older tools **might** still work, but are no longer actively maintained:
* Semantic Relatedness API
* GermaNet-Explorer

APPENDIX A: GERMANET DATA DESCRIPTION:

GermaNet is an online lexical-semantic database for German that has been structured along the same lines as the Princeton WordNet for English. It models nouns, verbs, and adjectives in their basic semantic relations like hyponymy, meronymy, and antonymy, and constitutes a basic resource for word sense disambiguation within NLP applications.

The development of the GermaNet resource has been directed by Prof. Erhard Hinrichs and has been supported by research grants awarded to Prof. Hinrichs by the Ministerium für Wissenschaft und Kunst Baden-Württemberg (MWK), the Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung (BMBF), the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG), and the European Commission. The following researchers and research assistants (listed in alphabetic order) have contributed to the construction of GermaNet and accompanying software:

Reinhild Barkey, Anna-Sophie Bartle, Agnia Barsukova, Valérie Béchet-Tsarnos, Anne Brock, Ben Campbell, Julia Chant, Alexandr Chernov, Edo Collins, Bettina Demmer, Valentin Deyringer, Helmut Feldweg, Patricia Fischer, Clemens Frey, Sabrina Galasso, Piklu Gupta, Annabell Grasse, Luca Haeselbarth, Marina Haid, Birgit Hamp,  Alexander Hartmann, Tanja Heck, Verena Henrich, Marie Hinrichs, Michael Hipp, Christina Hoppermann, Lars Horber, Julia Koch, Silke Kugler, Claudia Kunze, Anja Laske, Richard Lawrence, Alina Leippert, Lothar Lemnitzer, Andrea Lorenz, Karin Naumann, Annika Ott, Till Pachalli, Katrin Petodnig, Wei Qiu, Daniela Rossmann, Eyal Schejter, Niko Schenk, Susanne Schüle, Sarah Schulz, Daniil Sorokin, Rosemary Stegmann, Daniela Stelle, Daniela Stier, Yana Strakatova, Steffen Tacke, Christine Thielen, Tatiana Vodolazova, Andreas Wagner, Johannes Wahle, Zarah-Leonie Weiss, Neele Witte, Martin Wolf and Holger Wunsch.
