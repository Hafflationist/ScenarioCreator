GermaNet Release 16.0 - InterlingualIndex Mapping
=================================================

EuroWordNet is an extensive multilingual lexical database that was developed to connect wordnets of different languages to each other. The central component of this database is the Interlingual Index (ILI) that represents an unstructured list of meanings that allows a mapping of concepts of different languages. In the context of EuroWordNet, ~28,500 ILI records were created for GermaNet. This allows the mapping of GermaNet senses to the corresponding entries in the Princeton WordNet.

In the EuroWordNet framework, GermaNet has been linked to Princeton WordNet® 2.0. The mappings from WordNet® 2.0 to WordNet® 3.0 provided by the NLP group of the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (data link no longer available) were used to link GermaNet synsets to WordNet 3.0. Please note that the mappings to WordNet® 3.0 were created automatically, thus 100% accuracy of those mappings cannot be guaranteed.

For more information about the EuroWordNet, please see the project webpages of the GlobalWordNet (http://www.globalwordnet.org/) and the EuroWordNet (http://www.illc.uva.nl/EuroWordNet/) projects.
